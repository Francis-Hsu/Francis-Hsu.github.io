Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is an appealing method for parameter tuning. However, its high computational cost (requiring fitting the model $n$ times) often makes it infeasible in application. Our proposed method approximates the LOOCV estimations using only the full data fit and siginificantly reduced the time needed for risk estimation."
