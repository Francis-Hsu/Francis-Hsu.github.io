* I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My advisor is Prof. [Xiaohui Chen](https://the-xiaohuichen.github.io/).
* I received my M.A. in Statistics from [Columbia University](http://stat.columbia.edu/). My advisors at Columbia were Prof. [Bodhisattva Sen](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~bodhi/Bodhi/Welcome.html) and Prof. [Arian Maleki](https://sites.google.com/site/malekiarian/).
* My primary research interests are optimal transport and its applications in machine learning and statistics.
