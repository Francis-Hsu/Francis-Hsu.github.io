 * I am a Reasearch Associate in Statistics at Columbia University, New York. I currently works with Prof. [Bodhisattva Sen](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~bodhi/Bodhi/Welcome.html), Prof. [Arian Maleki](https://sites.google.com/site/malekiarian/), and Dr. [Margaret Holen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/margaret-holen-36068547/).
 * My research interests lie across many topics: machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, non-parametric methods, and optimal transportation. I am also interested in applications of statistics in finance.
