    <summary>Abstract</summary>
	<code>orthoDr</code> is a package in R that solves dimension reduction problems using orthogonality constrained optimization approach. The package serves as a unified framework for many regression and survival analysis dimension reduction models that utilize semiparametric estimating equations. The main computational machinery of `orthoDr` is a first-order algorithm developed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-012-0584-1">Wen and Yin</a> (2012) for optimization within the Stiefel manifold. We implement the algorithm through Rcpp and OpenMP for fast computation. In addition, we developed a general-purpose solver for such constrained problems with user-specified objective functions, which works as a drop-in version of <code>optim()</code>. The package also serves as a platform for future methodology developments along this line of work.
