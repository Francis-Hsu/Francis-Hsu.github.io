## Abstract
`orthoDr` is a package in R that solves dimension reduction problems using orthogonality constrained optimization approach. The package serves as a unified framework for many regression and survival analysis dimension reduction models that utilize semiparametric estimating equations. The main computational machinery of `orthoDr` is a first-order algorithm developed by [Wen and Yin](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-012-0584-1) ([2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-012-0584-1)) for optimization within the Stiefel manifold. We implement the algorithm through Rcpp and OpenMP for fast computation. In addition, we developed a general-purpose solver for such constrained problems with user-specified objective functions, which works as a drop-in version of `optim()`. The package also serves as a platform for future methodology developments along this line of work.
